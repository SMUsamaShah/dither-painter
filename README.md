# dither-painter

Made with ChatGPT 5

## First main prompt.

I want to make a very simple paint tool in JS/HTML. Only thing unique about this one is that it has a very limited colour pallette and the brush tool will use Flyod Steinberg dithering to paint any colour. It will have a colour pallette box which will let us limit the colours to those colour palletes. But yet, it will have a bigger colour picker panel like MS paint. Those colours will actually be the dithered colours. It will let us paint with limited colour pallete, but it will look like the image has all colours. Do you understand, make a plan what the UI will look like first and then implement it. Are there any flaws in my idea? I don't need predefined presets btw, neither do I want to switch between any presets while painting

## Main prompt after I got a working version.

I am making a very simple paint tool in JS/HTML. Thing unique about this one is that it has a very limited colour pallette and the brush tool will use Flyod Steinberg dithering to paint any colour. It has a colour pallette box which let us limit the colours to those colour palletes. But still it let us pick any colour like MS paint to draw on canvas. Drawing is done with dithered colours such that it looks like the image has all colours. 

This is my current code. Change/fix X ...
